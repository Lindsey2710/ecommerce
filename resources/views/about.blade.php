          <h3 class="mb-4">MY STORY</h3>
          <p class="fs-6 fw-medium mb-4">This is a little about me and why I started programming, making websites and e-commerce
            sites instead of keep working with horses fulltime...</p>
          <p class="mb-4">After spending over 30 years working with horses, I’ve developed a deep understanding of the equestrian world.
             However, the physical toll of the horse industry, combined with the realization that I’m mortal and breakable (who knew, right?),
              led me to seek a new full-time career. Though I still work with riders and their horses, I decided to make a transition into
              IT to pursue my passion for learning and growth.
            <br>
            In 2023, I started programming and quickly became captivated by web development.
            I dove into Laravel and built a fully functional e-commerce website from scratch using Laravel 11. The project also
             features a complete admin dashboard, giving me the chance to implement both user-friendly design and powerful backend functionality.
              This shift into IT has been an exciting and fulfilling chapter, where I continue to expand my skills and explore new challenges..</p>
